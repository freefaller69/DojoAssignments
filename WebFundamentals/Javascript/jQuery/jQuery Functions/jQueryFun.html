    <h1>Don't act so surprised...</h1>
    <p><span>Don't act so surprised</span>, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

    <h2>Don't underestimate the Force.</h2>
    <p><span>A tremor in the Force.</span> The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
    <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
    <h3>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.</h3>
    <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
    <p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I'm trying not to, kid. He is here.</p>
    <p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
    <p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
    <p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
    <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
    <p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! You don't believe in the Force, do you? I'm trying not to, kid. He is here. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>
    <p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. You mean it controls your actions? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
    <p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
    <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
    <p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
    <h4>Hi there</h4>
    <p>I'm trying not to, kid. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
    <p>What!? Ye-ha! Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>
